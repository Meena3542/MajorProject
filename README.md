Student dropout rates in India are influenced by socio-economic and educational factors, affecting marginalized
communities the most. Addressing dropout rates is essential for equitable education and socio- economic development. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the importance of reducing dropout rates and ensuring quality
education up to at least the secondary level. This solution focuses on creating software tools to address and reduce dropout rates. The tools will help identify atrisk students, provide personalized support, and engage communities. By leveraging technology, the aim is to improve
student retention, align with NEP 2020’s goals, and support a holistic approach to education. Innovative Software
Solutions are:
AI-Driven Early Warning System: Develop an AI-powered software platform that analyzes student data (attendance, grades, behaviour) to predict which students are at risk of dropping out. The system will provide alerts to educators and
administrators, enabling timely interventions. Predictive analytics, real-time alerts, data visualization, and intervention
recommendations. Community Learning Hub Platform: Create an online platform that supports community learning hubs in rural and
unavailability of resources. This platform will offer digital resources, tutoring sessions, and virtual mentoring, providing additional educational support to students.Resource library and community forums. Financial Support Management System: Build a software system to manage scholarship and financial aid
applications. The platform will streamline the application process, track disbursements, and provide information on
available financial support to reduce economic barriers. Application tracking, financial aid management, eligibility
assessment, and reporting tools. Flexible Schooling Management System:A Flexible Schooling Management System allows students to enroll in
evening or part-time programs, manage schedules, and track academic progress. It provides enrolment management, dynamic schedule tracking, and progress monitoring features. The system integrates with existing school systems for
seamless data synchronization and supports user roles for students, instructors, and admins, ensuring scalability, security, and mobile access. Student Support and Engagement System: Develop an integrated system that provides personalized support and
engagement for students at risk of dropping out. Features will include counselling support, motivational content, and
tools for setting and tracking academic goals. Counselling resources, goal-setting tools, motivational content, and
engagement tracking. By implementing these software solutions, the goal is to reduce dropout rates significantly by
addressing the key factors that contribute to student attrition. These solutions are designed to align with the NEP
2020’s objective of ensuring universal access to education and improving student retention.
